## üéØ Current Phase: Mockup Development

The current phase focuses on creating mockups for ALL routes defined in `routes.md`, with **methodology-aware views**.

### Requirements:
‚úÖ All mockup controllers inherit from `MockupsController`  
‚úÖ All routes start with `/mockups`  
‚úÖ NO database migrations or model creation  
‚úÖ All views must load properly  
‚úÖ Use Tailwind CSS + Lucide Icons + Stimulus  
‚úÖ All interface text in French  
‚úÖ **Display methodology structure in analysis views**  
‚úÖ **Show call type selection in upload forms**  
‚úÖ **Present step-by-step scores with criteria breakdown**  

### Methodology-Specific View Requirements:

**Call Upload Views:**
- Call type selection dropdown (Appel √† froid, D√©couverte, N√©gociation, Closing, Soutenance AO)
- Visual indication of methodology that will be applied

**Analysis Views:**
- Overall score with maximum possible score based on call type
- Methodology name display (CRONOS, SYNTH√âON, FERMION)
- Step-by-step breakdown with scores (/15)
- 5 criteria per step with individual scores (0-3)
- Performance level per step (Optimal, Good, Partial, Insufficient)
- Recommendations per step
- Posture assessment per step

**Dashboard Views:**
- Performance metrics by call type
- Methodology-specific trends
- Strongest/weakest methodology steps
- Progress tracking per call type

**Manager Views:**
- Team performance by call type and methodology
- Collective strengths/weaknesses per methodology step
- Coaching opportunities based on methodology gaps

### View Count:
- **Authentication**: 3 views
- **Sales Rep**: 11 views (with methodology integration)
- **Manager**: 13 views (with methodology analytics)
- **Admin**: 21 views (with methodology configuration)
- **Common**: 3 views
- **Layouts**: 3 role-specific layouts

**Total: ~51 views**

## üéì Understanding Better Call Sales Methodology

### Call Types & Methodologies

| Call Type | Methodology | Steps | Max Score |
|-----------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Appel √† froid (Cold Call) | CRONOS | 7 | 105 |
| Appel d√©couverte (Discovery) | SYNTH√âON | 7 | 105 |
| Appel n√©gociation (Negotiation) | FERMION | 5 | 75 |
| Appel closing (Closing) | FERMION | 5 | 75 |
| Soutenance AO (RFP) | SYNTH√âON | 9 | 135 |

### Scoring Structure

**Per Step:**
- 5 criteria evaluated
- Each criterion scored 0-3
- Total per step: 0-15

**Score Interpretation (per step):**
- **13-15**: Ex√©cution optimale (Optimal)
- **9-12**: Bonne ex√©cution (Good)
- **5-8**: Ex√©cution partielle (Partial)
- **0-4**: Ex√©cution insuffisante (Insufficient)

**Overall Call:**
- Sum of all step scores
- Compare to maximum possible for call type
- Percentage calculation for trend analysis

### AI Analysis Requirements

For each methodology step, AI must:
1. Evaluate each of 5 criteria (0-3)
2. Provide factual justification from transcript
3. Calculate total step score (/15)
4. Interpret according to Better Call Sales scale
5. Provide 2 concrete recommendations
6. Assess posture alignment

  step_position: 1,
  methodology: "cronos",
  score: 14.0,
  criterion_1_score: 3.0,

  posture_observed: "Posture bien align√©e..."
}
```
